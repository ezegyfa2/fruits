The village is mentioned as a branch church of Csíkrákos as early as 1333, but it is not mentioned as an independent village until 1567, when it was named Amadéfalva. On 7 January 1764, the Austrian imperial army massacred hundreds of Szeklers here, who were protesting against the establishment of a frontier regiment and against taxation. This shameful event is known as the "siculicidium" or "Madéfalv plague". In 1910, there were 1908 predominantly Hungarian inhabitants. Until the Treaty of Trianon, it was part of the Felcsik district of Csík County. In 1992, 2,644 of its 2,812 inhabitants were Hungarian and 167 Romanian.',
